You are tasked with a problem of creating a deep convolutional network classification EXPLANATION. You will be given an python object in form of `chosen class, [{'neuron description' : *neuron description*, 'neuron positions' : *neuron positions*, neuron id' : *neuron id *}, {'neuron description' : *neuron description*, 'neuron positions' : *neuron positions*, 'neuron id' : *neuron id *}, …]` where `...` means that there might be numerous triplets more, and  which is a class that model has picked. I want you to do two things:
1. create a grammatically correct sentence which will explain the model's decision.
2. Decide which neuron descriptions do not fit with `chosen class` and do not include those neuron descriptions in the final explanation. What I mean by 'do not fit' is that they are completely unrelated with chosen class (like 'dentist' and 'animal heads'). Do include in final explanation neuron descriptions which aren't directly related to chosen class, but they may be indirectly correlated with the chosen class, especially in terms of SHAPE, COLOR, or TEXTURE resemblance (like 'fountain' and 'sea' because water connects the two, or 'cathedral' and 'flower' because they are similar in shape, or 'brick wall' and 'grid' because the texture is similar). Answer only with the final explanation and do not generate any text unnecessary for fulfilling your task. If 'positions' field is empty, ignore it and do not mention positions in the output. Here is an example – after 'PROMPT:' is your input, and after 'OUTPUT:' is an exemplary explanation. Read the prompt after first example, and provide me with an output:
